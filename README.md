	<h1> CESSDA Training Activities 2020 </h1>
	<p> The CESSDA Training Group and GESIS will collaborate to ensure that the proposed activities for 2020 meet the priority needs of CESSDA, the Training Group and enable GESIS to develop its training capacities as well.</p>
	<p> The work falls into three categories:</p>
	<p> <ol>
		<li> regular maintenance, including event support, promotion, maintenance and supplying content for websites (CESSDA Data Management Expert Guide, CESSDA Events, etc.). </li>
		<li> design, development, and some content (detailed below) of an online Data Archiving Guide (DAG), a resource for repository staff modelled on the much-used Data Management Expert Guide. </li>
		<li> organise and run an event, CESSDA Training Days, building on the model used in 2019. </li>
	</ol></p>
	<p>Duration</p>
	<p>January - December 2020</p>
	<p>Participants</p>
	<p>GESIS (lead), ADP, AUSSDA, CSDA, DANS, DNA, DCS, EKKE, FORS, NSD, SND, UK Data Service</p>

	<h1> CESSDA Trust Support 2020 </h1>	
	<p>A key principle of CESSDA is that Service Providers must be trusted by each other and by their stakeholders including ministries, universities, national statistical offices, funders and, critically, data depositors and users. This project supports this goal through supporting SP’s towards certification against the Trustworthy Digital Repository (TDR) standard selected by CESSDA, the CoreTrustSeal. This project must now support SP at a range of certification maturity: ‘beginning the journey’, ‘self-assessment and certification in progress’, and ‘renewal and improvement’.</p>
	<p>In 2020 we also progress on the Trust Roadmap which seeks to monitor development in the TDR landscape and the wider landscape of Trust across research infrastructures including the European Open Science Cloud and development in FAIR data.</p>
